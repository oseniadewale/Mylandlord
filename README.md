# 🏠 Landlord-Tenant Management App

A web-based **Landlord-Tenant Management System** built with **PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to streamline communication and property management between landlords and tenants.

This application enables landlords to manage their properties, view tenants, and track payments — while tenants can view houses, make payments, and check their payment history.  
It includes **admin control**, **secure authentication**, and **role-based access** (Admin, Landlord, Tenant).
